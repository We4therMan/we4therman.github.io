        <h2>Development progress</h2>

        <p class="bigger">
            The development stages are more or less listed in the order in which I'm working on them; i.e., generally
            I focus on writing and finishing questions before working on music, etc.
            <br>
            Progress estimates relating to the demo are colored <span class="d">green</span>.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Development stage</th>
                <th style="width: 250px;">Estimated progress (super accurate!!1!)</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Draft of main game and gimmicks</td>
                <td><span class="d">>95%</span></td>
                <td>
                    By this, I mean mostly a mental draft. I've got a pretty good idea by now of how the quiz is 
                    gonna work. I may add an idea or two along the way, but the main stuff is pretty much finalized.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Main game structure (code)</td>
                <td><span class="d">75%</span></td>
                <td>
                    This is what controls things like how questions are displayed, how the game keeps track of your score,
                    and how it's displayed when you finish the quiz, among other stuff.
                    <br><br>
                    As of now, the main stuff is close to done, but needs a lot of repair. The main task then will 
                    be to finish writing enough questions to test that the code works properly for a full playthrough of the quiz.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Special events (code)</td>
                <td>Full game: 20%<br><span class="d">Demo: 60%</span></td>
                <td>
                    Some questions have what I'm calling "special events": stuff like an image displaying, or
                    a random variable, for more complex questions.
                    <br><br>
                    There's some progress on this, but most
                    special event questions are not finished. This won't affect the demo release as much, since it won't have as many questions.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Questions</td>
                <td>Main game: 40%<br><span class="d">Demo: >95%</span></td>
                <td>
                    The main game will have quite a few more questions than the demo. I've got about 50 written so far (some are bonus questions).
                    For the demo, I will pick a few out of those, and probably won't have to write additional ones (unless
                    I get a great idea).
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Music and sound effects</td>
                <td>Full game: 25%<br><span class="d">Demo: 70%</span></td>
                <td>
                    The track for the first section of the quiz is undergoing revision. The tracks for the intro and tutorial parts
                    of the quiz are almost complete; luckily, they are short and required less work.
